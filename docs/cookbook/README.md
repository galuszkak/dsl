# Structurizr DSL cookbook

Creating software architecture diagrams from a textual definition ("diagrams as code") is becoming more popular,
but if you have a collection of related diagrams, it's easy to introduce inconsistencies if you don't keep the many
diagram source files in sync.

This cookbook is a tutorial guide to the Structurizr DSL, an open source tool for creating diagrams as code from
a single consistent model. This cookbook assumes that you're using the diagram renderer provided by the
[Structurizr cloud service](https://structurizr.com/help/cloud-service),
the [Structurizr on-premises installation](https://structurizr.com/help/on-premises),
or [Structurizr Lite](https://structurizr.com/help/lite).
Please note that some features (e.g. perspectives, element style shapes/icons, etc) may not be supported if you're
using one of the PlantUML/Mermaid/D2/DOT/etc export formats provided by the
[Structurizr CLI](https://github.com/structurizr/cli) and the [structurizr-export library](https://github.com/structurizr/export).
